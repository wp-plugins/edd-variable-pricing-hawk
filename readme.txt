Keep your customers honest when selecting options for variable pricing products in Easy Digital Downloads

== Description ==

Ever wonder if your customers are really being honest when they pick the cheapest license option for your store's products? 
Or maybe they just click purchase without realizing they should first select a higher priced license.

Variable Pricing Hawk keeps a friendly eye on your customers to encourage them to pick the correct license for your variable 
priced products.

Requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/)

= How it works =

The plugin adds a 'Blank all selections by default' checkbox to the variable pricing section of each product. If checked, 
this will ensure all radio buttons are 'off' to start with when the product is displayed to a potential customer. 
This forces the purchaser to actively select the correct license rather than just relying on the default - which is often 
the cheapest...

It also adds an 'Alert Text' column to the variable pricing grid - you can add optional text next to each individual pricing 
option. Then, when the purchaser clicks on that option, the alert will display in blue beneath the option. For example, you 
might display: By selecting this option you confirm you will not install this plugin on more than one WordPress site.

Between them, these features help keep users switched on and honest!
